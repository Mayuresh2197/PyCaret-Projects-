# PyCaret Projects 

This repository includes ML projects that I learned using PyCaret and several blogs based on the same. Will keep adding more projects as I proceed. 

For now, I have added a project for Titanic Survival Prediction using PyCaret's low-code features. It is an amazing library for learning Machine Learning. With several inbuilt datasets and models, it becomes very easy to get a grasp of things happening. 

Thanks to the creator Moez Ali. You can check out PyCaret here - https://pycaret.org/
